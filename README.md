Hello humans! Here is my lovely thesis, enjoy! 

A web service based on a convolutional neural network for extracting spatial objects from satellite images has been successfully developed.
Based on various available algorithms using convolutional neural networks, the YOLOv8 network was selected.
The model not only performs classification, detection, but also segmentation of detected objects.
According to users, it is the best network performing segmentation.
The model performs in a really satisfactory way.
The data needed to train the model was collected.
Each satellite image was labeled with objects of three selected classes (buildings, roads, water).
A web service was created to easily and affordably perform real-time segmentation of the objects of the three classes in the satellite images.
The application works very well, and the results of the model segmentation can be downloaded as a GeoJSON file.
